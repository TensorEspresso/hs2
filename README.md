# Hierarchical Structure of Health Systems (HS2)

US Health System hierarchy — validated, typed relationships.

## Model

### Tiers

| Tier | Entity Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Root | Health System | University of Michigan Health |
| Tier 1 | Hospitals / Medical Centers | C.S. Mott Children's Hospital |
| Tier 2 | Specialty Centers / Ambulatory Care Centers | Kellogg Eye Center |
| Tier 3 | Clinics / Satellite Locations / Provider Practices | UW Medicine Primary Care |

**Tier 2 vs Tier 3 distinction:** Tier 2 = specialty centers with independent brand identity and focused multi-service array (e.g., "Kellogg Eye Center," "Karmanos Cancer Institute"). Tier 3 = general clinics, satellite offices, provider practices — community-level access points with limited service (e.g., "Urology Clinic," "Pediatric Cardiology in Flint"). The dividing line is independent brand identity and service array, not naming convention alone.

**Evidence:** Every major US health system self-describes with this 3-level structure below the system root. UM Health: "3 hospitals, 6 specialty treatment centers and over 50 clinics." Cleveland Clinic: "23 hospitals, 276 outpatient facilities, 18 Family Health and Service Centers." Kaiser: "40 hospitals and 609 medical facilities." See `references/tier-system-research.md` for full research.

### Relationship Types

| Type | Binding | Control | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **owns** | Equity ownership | Full | SEC filings, EIN overlap, state business registry |
| **manages** | Management contract | Operational | "Operated by" language, contract references |
| **partners_with** | Formal contract | Shared | Joint venture agreements, revenue sharing, clinical partnerships |

Loose affiliations (no contract, no equity) are **not** included.

### Validation

| Confidence | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **high** | 1 authoritative source (SEC, state licensing, CMS) |
| **medium** | 2 corroborating non-authoritative sources |
| **low** | 1 non-authoritative source |
| **inferred** | Pattern-based (naming, address overlap) — review queue only |
